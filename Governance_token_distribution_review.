# Governance Proposal — CNET Token Distribution Review  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** ☐ Draft / ☐ Under Review / ☐ Approved / ☐ Rejected  
**Author:** Governance Circle  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

---

## 1. Proposal Summary  
This proposal initiates a **comprehensive review and optimization** of the $CNET token distribution structure to ensure alignment with CampusNetDAO’s long-term governance and community growth objectives.

---

## 2. Motivation  
The current token allocation (100,000,000 CNET on Solana Devnet) served as a proof-of-concept phase.  
As the DAO transitions toward mainnet and real-world operations, it’s critical to rebalance allocations between governance, community rewards, partnerships, and the treasury.  

This review ensures:
- Governance power remains decentralized.  
- Long-term sustainability of incentive programs.  
- Transparent, fair token vesting for contributors.

|------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Conduct full audit of existing token distribution and usage | Governance Circle | 1 week |
| 2 | Collect feedback from all DAO circles on allocation needs | All Circles | 1 week |
| 3 | Draft and publish new tokenomics framework | Treasury & Governance Circles | 2 weeks |
| 4 | Community voting on updated allocation | Governance Circle | 3 days |
| 5 | Implement new distribution parameters on-chain (Devnet → Mainnet) | Core Devs | 1 week |

## 4. Budget & Token Allocation  

| Category | Amount (CNET) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Governance Operations | 5,000 | Coordination, auditing, and documentation |

| Publication & Transparency Costs | 2,000 | Dashboard + public record updates |
| **Total** | **17,000 CNET** | Governance Review Budget |

---

## 5. Expected Outcomes & KPIs  
- New tokenomics model with clear allocations and vesting schedules.  
- Minimum 20 active members contribute governance feedback.  
- Transparent DAO token dashboard published on GitHub.  
- Increased voter participation (≥25% of circulating CNET).

## 6. Governance Impact  
This proposal enhances DAO legitimacy by aligning token governance with real participation rather than central control.  
It reaffirms CampusNetDAO’s founding value — **students govern, not gatekeepers**.  
Oversight: **Governance Circle**, validated by **Core Contributors**.
