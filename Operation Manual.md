CampusNetDAO Operations & Execution Framework (v1.0)
1. Purpose

This manual defines how CampusNetDAO operates across its governance, technical, and contributor layers.
It provides a structured system for task execution, accountability, automation, and reporting, ensuring that DAO operations scale without losing transparency or efficiency.

2. Governance Operations Overview
Tier	Role	Description
Core Council	Governance Stewards	Oversee governance processes, verify proposals, and manage treasury authorizations.
Student Members	Community Contributors	Participate in proposals, bounties, and skill-based projects.
Graduates/Alumni	Mentorship & Advisory	Guide project execution, mentor contributors, and facilitate partnerships.
Developers & Builders	Technical Backbone	Maintain DAO smart contracts, PayHub infrastructure, and on-chain integrations.

Decision Cycle:

Proposal → Vote → Implementation → Reporting → Review

Governance operations are synced weekly, and all DAO actions are mirrored in the Governance Hash Registry.

3. Operational Cycles
Cycle	Duration	Purpose
Governance Epoch	30 days	Major proposals and treasury decisions
Project Sprint	2 weeks	Task and bounty execution
Evaluation Cycle	Quarterly	Review KPIs, update roles, and adjust token allocations

Each cycle closes with a DAO-wide Summary Report pinned to IPFS for record-keeping.

4. Task Execution Framework

All work within CampusNetDAO follows a Work-to-Earn model.

Stage	Tool/Platform	Output
Task Listing	Dework / Wonderverse	On-chain bounty board
Assignment	Discord or PayHub	Contributor-task mapping
Submission	GitHub / PayHub	Deliverable
Verification	DAO Review Council	Approval or revision
Payout	PayHub (CNET / SOL)	Token distribution

Each task carries a defined:

Scope

Reward (CNET or SOL equivalent)

Deadline

Review criteria

5. Tooling Stack
Function	Tool	Integration
Governance Voting	Snapshot (off-chain) / Realms (on-chain)	Weighted by CNET balance
Access Control	Guild.xyz or Collab.Land	Token-gated Discord roles
Automation	Wonderverse / Dework + Discord bots	Task coordination
Payments	CampusNet PayHub (CNET / SOL)	Automated bounty payout
Documentation	GitHub + IPFS	Immutable knowledge base
Analytics	Dune Dashboard (planned)	DAO activity metrics
6. Communication & Coordination

Official Channels:

Discord (primary)

X (formerly Twitter) for public updates

GitHub for documentation

Notion or Dework for task boards

All internal communications are logged in an archive channel or mirrored through the Governance Hash Registry for transparency.

7. Contributor Onboarding
Phase	Description
Application	Apply via CampusNetDAO portal (GitHub + Discord integration)
Verification	Optional student/alumni verification
Orientation	Review DAO Constitution, Whitepaper, and Governance Charter
Activation	Receive CNET balance and role access
Contribution	Begin participating in proposals, bounties, and projects

New members complete an onboarding task worth a symbolic reward to confirm readiness.

8. Treasury Operations

All treasury activities follow the CampusNetDAO Treasury Policy.
Key highlights:

Multi-signature controlled treasury (core council + automation bot)

48-hour delay window for all outbound transactions

Transparent, traceable fund flow via on-chain audit logs

Quarterly public financial summaries pinned to IPFS

9. Reporting & Accountability

Every workstream must produce:

Task completion report

Budget report

Impact summary

Quarterly performance review

Reports are reviewed by the Governance Council and stored under:
/reports/<quarter>/<project_name>.md

10. Incident Response & Escalation
Level	Incident Type	Resolution Path
1	Minor task delay or miscommunication	Peer resolution or moderator intervention
2	Payment or contract issue	DAO support + PayHub review
3	Governance manipulation or abuse	Emergency DAO Proposal → Council Arbitration
4	Smart contract vulnerability	Technical Team + Security Framework procedure
11. Automation & AI Operations

CampusNetDAO employs AI-assisted governance and automation for:

Vote counting verification

On-chain treasury sync

Bounty management

Member onboarding analytics

Automations operate via CampusNet Bot v1.0, linked to:

Discord (role + command automation)

PayHub (bounty-to-payout workflow)

Governance Registry (proposal hash validation)

12. Operational Integrity

All DAO actions — proposals, payments, and votes — are logged and hashed for public verification under:

/governance_registry/
   ├── hash_registry_blueprint.md
   ├── implementation_spec.md
   ├── governance_registry_config.toml

13. Review & Continuous Improvement

This manual is reviewed every 90 days and updated through a governance proposal.
