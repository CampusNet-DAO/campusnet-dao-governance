CampusNetDAO Constitution

Version: 1.0
Chain: Solana Devnet
Token: CNET
Date: October 2025

Preamble

We, the members of CampusNetDAO, unite to establish a decentralized, student-driven ecosystem designed to empower learners, innovators, and builders through collective governance, transparent collaboration, and sustainable community ownership.

This Constitution stands as the foundational charter of the DAO — defining its mission, authority, and governance principles. Every proposal, policy, and upgrade shall align with these founding ideals.

Article I — Identity and Purpose

Name: CampusNetDAO (The “DAO”).

Nature: A decentralized autonomous organization operating on the Solana blockchain, governed by holders of the CNET token.

Purpose:

Empower student-led innovation, entrepreneurship, and education in Web3.

Establish transparent, democratic decision-making systems for campus-based and online communities.

Serve as an incubator for student-driven projects under collective DAO governance.

Transition the DAO into a long-term, self-sustaining digital institution.

Article II — Authority and Governance

Supreme Authority: The DAO operates under the collective authority of token holders.

Governance Mechanism:

Proposals, discussions, and votes are facilitated through the DAO’s governance tools (e.g., Snapshot, Discord, or on-chain modules).

Decision-making power corresponds proportionally to CNET token holdings.

Core governance operations (proposal creation, execution, and upgrade votes) are automated via DAO smart contracts.

Transparency Requirement:

All treasury transactions, proposal results, and operational decisions shall be publicly accessible.

Governance archives shall be maintained on-chain and mirrored via IPFS for immutability.

Article III — Membership

Eligibility:

Students, graduates, and verified community contributors may hold membership.

Membership is represented through CNET token ownership and verified DAO identity credentials.

Member Rights:

Vote on proposals.

Submit and co-sponsor proposals.

Access DAO community tools and grants.

Participate in working groups and subcommittees.

Member Responsibilities:

Act in good faith, prioritizing community growth.

Uphold ethical standards outlined in the DAO’s Code of Conduct.

Maintain transparency when handling DAO resources.

Article IV — Governance Tiers

Community Members: General DAO participants with voting rights proportional to their CNET holdings.

Core Contributors: Verified members managing technical, operational, or creative roles; subject to DAO oversight.

Council Members: Senior or elected representatives responsible for coordinating governance execution, dispute resolution, and DAO upgrades.

Founding Team: Original architects and early contributors, vested over a defined term (12–24 months), holding non-permanent authority for transition stability.

Article V — Treasury and Resource Control

The DAO Treasury shall be the single, transparent pool of funds controlled by DAO smart contracts.

All transactions must be traceable and publicly viewable.

Allocation of funds, bounties, or grants must be approved through governance voting.

Multi-signature wallets or programmatic treasuries (e.g., Realms, Squads) will be used for fund execution and safety.

Diversification into stable assets or staking protocols requires DAO-level approval.

Article VI — Proposals and Voting

Proposal Stages:

Draft: Discussion phase (Discord or governance forum).

Submission: Formalized proposal submitted for Snapshot or on-chain voting.

Voting: Eligible members vote within a defined time window.

Execution: Approved proposals automatically executed by DAO smart contracts.

Voting Power: Determined by CNET token holdings.

Quorum Requirements:

Minimum participation of 10% of circulating CNET tokens for valid outcomes.

Majority Rule:

Simple majority (>50%) for regular proposals.

Supermajority (≥66%) for constitutional or structural amendments.

Article VII — Amendments

This Constitution may be amended through a Constitutional Proposal process requiring a supermajority (66%) approval.

All amendments must be published as a new version (e.g., v1.1, v2.0) with a clear changelog.

Historical versions shall remain accessible for public reference and accountability.

Article VIII — Dissolution

The DAO may only be dissolved through a supermajority vote (≥75%).

Upon dissolution, remaining treasury assets shall be distributed proportionally among verified DAO members, unless otherwise directed by the community.

Article IX — Legal and Compliance

CampusNetDAO operates as a decentralized entity without central legal registration, except as required for regional compliance.

Contributors act as independent agents, not employees or representatives of a legal corporation.

The DAO assumes no responsibility for unauthorized third-party actions.

Article X — Ratification

This Constitution takes effect immediately upon community ratification through a governance proposal approved by the DAO’s active members.
