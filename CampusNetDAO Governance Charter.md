CampusNetDAO Governance Charter

Version: 1.0
Chain: Solana Devnet
Token: CNET
Date: October 2025

1. Purpose & Scope

This Governance Charter defines the institutional backbone of CampusNetDAO — the procedures, responsibilities, and authorities guiding all governance functions.
It ensures transparent, democratic, and efficient decision-making aligned with CampusNetDAO’s mission: to empower students and Web3 contributors in a sustainable decentralized ecosystem.

2. Governance Principles

The DAO operates under five non-negotiable principles:

Transparency – All actions, proposals, and fund movements are publicly verifiable on-chain.

Accountability – Members and leadership are subject to structured performance and ethical review.

Participation – Every verified member has a pathway to decision-making influence.

Equity – No member or group may exercise unilateral authority over treasury or governance.

Progressive Decentralization – Power and control shift gradually from the founding team to the broader community.

3. Governance Structure

CampusNetDAO governance follows a three-tier structure, balancing democratic engagement and operational efficiency.

Tier	Body	Description
Tier 1	General Assembly	All token holders (≥1 CNET). Holds baseline voting rights.
Tier 2	Core Council	Elected body responsible for managing DAO operations, treasury, and proposals.
Tier 3	Founding Governance Committee	Transitional oversight team until full decentralization (max. 12–18 months).
4. Roles and Responsibilities
A. General Assembly

Review, discuss, and vote on proposals.

Elect or recall council members.

Participate in referenda for constitutional or charter changes.

Approve budget allocations exceeding 10% of treasury reserves.

B. Core Council

Execute DAO-approved decisions.

Maintain treasury operations and token allocation schedules.

Vet and publish proposals for DAO-wide voting.

Collaborate with contributor teams and sub-DAOs.

Publish quarterly reports on performance and governance metrics.

Council Members must:

Hold ≥2,000 CNET staked.

Maintain >70% participation rate in votes.

Sign off on all on-chain treasury actions via multisig or equivalent smart contract authority.

C. Founding Governance Committee

Temporary governing body with limited powers:

Advisory authority only.

No access to treasury after decentralization phase.

Role sunsets automatically after 18 months or upon DAO vote.

5. Voting and Proposal Mechanisms
Proposal Type	Voting Threshold	Voting Duration	Eligible Voters
Standard Governance Proposal	≥50% majority	5 days	All verified members
Constitutional Amendment	≥66% supermajority	7 days	All members with ≥100 CNET
Budget Proposal	≥60% majority	5 days	Core + Council voters

Voting Platform: Snapshot or Solana on-chain governance module.
Proposal Sponsorship: Requires endorsement from at least one Core Member or Council Member.
Quorum: Minimum 10% of total CNET circulation must participate for vote validity.

6. Treasury Governance

CampusNetDAO Treasury operates under multi-signature control and DAO vote authorization.

Managed by 3–5 Council signers.

2-of-3 or 3-of-5 multisig threshold depending on transaction size.

All treasury transactions recorded via Solana explorer and DAO dashboard.

Treasury allocations categorized as:

Operational – Infrastructure, maintenance, and tooling.

Ecosystem Growth – Grants, bounties, and onboarding programs.

Community Fund – Incentives and social impact initiatives.

Quarterly audits are mandatory and published publicly.

7. Conflict Resolution & Dispute Management

When governance disputes arise:

The involved parties submit a written dispute statement to the DAO Ethics Board (subset of Council).

The board reviews and mediates a resolution within 14 days.

If unresolved, the issue escalates to DAO-wide vote via Conflict Proposal.

Final decision is binding and recorded on-chain.

Misconduct penalties include:

Temporary suspension from voting or proposals.

Role demotion (Council → Core → Contributor).

Revocation of DAO privileges through formal DAO vote.

8. DAO Transparency Framework

The DAO maintains a public transparency dashboard including:

Token distribution and vesting schedules.

Monthly financial statements.

Active proposals and results.

Council member participation metrics.

All data is open-source and available for verification through the DAO’s GitHub and Solana Explorer.

9. Amendment and Versioning

Changes to this Charter require:

Formal Governance Proposal submission.

≥66% approval threshold.

Publication of amendment record in /changelog/GovernanceCharter.md.

Updated version tagged and stored via IPFS for immutability.

10. Enforcement

Any DAO member may challenge non-compliance with this Charter via a Governance Dispute Proposal.
Violation of Charter provisions constitutes grounds for governance penalties or loss of council privileges.

11. Ratification

This Governance Charter becomes binding upon approval by DAO vote with ≥60% support and remains in force until superseded by a ratified update.

Authorized by:
CampusNetDAO Core Council
