CampusNet DAO – Legal, Regulatory, and Governance Compliance Policy (v1.0)
1. Purpose

This document establishes the legal and compliance framework for CampusNet DAO.
It defines the DAO’s legal positioning, jurisdictional strategy, risk controls, and operational compliance roadmap — ensuring that all DAO activities align with relevant laws, ethical standards, and community governance principles.

2. Entity Structure

CampusNet DAO currently operates as a decentralized autonomous organization deployed on the Solana blockchain (Devnet).
Upon transition to mainnet, the DAO will form a legal wrapper entity for regulatory clarity and limited liability protection.

Recommended structure:

Type: Nonprofit Association / DAO Foundation

Jurisdiction: Seychelles or Cayman Islands (DAO-friendly, crypto-compliant)

Purpose: Manage governance tokens, treasury assets, and smart contract operations on behalf of the DAO community.

3. Legal Objectives

Protect DAO contributors and token holders from individual liability.

Enable legally compliant treasury operations and funding mechanisms.

Establish a structure for potential partnerships with universities, startups, and Web3 organizations.

Support DAO-to-DAO collaborations under recognized legal standards.

4. Governance Token (CNET) Legal Classification

Nature: Governance utility token (non-investment instrument).

Use Cases:

Voting and proposal participation

Bounty and reward payments

Community staking for governance reputation

CNET is not a financial security.
It has no intrinsic monetary promise or ownership claim to DAO assets, aligning with international guidance (e.g., FinHub, EU MiCA guidelines).

5. KYC & Compliance Measures

While CampusNetDAO values permissionless participation, it maintains selective verification for key operations:

DAO Treasury Signers

Proposal Executors

Governance Council Members

Grant & Partnership Beneficiaries

Verification methods:

Student ID or institutional email (for student-tier membership)

Optional decentralized KYC via Civic Pass or Gitcoin Passport

All data anonymized and zero-knowledge verifiable where possible.

6. Treasury & Tax Compliance

Treasury wallets are multi-signature and auditable.

All financial actions are logged on-chain and mirrored in the Governance Hash Registry.

Income from partnerships, grants, or NFT sales will be transparently declared via DAO reports.

A global accountant or legal partner will be onboarded post-mainnet activation to manage fiat-to-crypto compliance.

7. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights

All official DAO assets, designs, documentation, and smart contracts are licensed under:

CampusNetDAO Community License (CNCL-1.0) – a custom derivative of MIT, enabling open use with attribution and DAO recognition.

Core rights retained by:

CampusNetDAO Foundation (post-legal wrapper creation)

Contributors under DAO-granted licenses

8. Dispute Resolution Framework

In the event of disputes:

Primary resolution through DAO Proposal-based Arbitration.

Secondary mediation via CampusNetDAO Foundation Legal Board.

If unresolved, final arbitration under Swiss or Cayman International Arbitration Tribunal.

9. Data Protection & Privacy

DAO operations comply with GDPR-equivalent privacy principles.

No central storage of personal data.

On-chain data is pseudonymous, and off-chain systems use encryption and selective disclosure.

10. Legal Evolution Plan
Phase	Milestone	Description
Phase 1	Devnet DAO	Test environment governance under Solana Devnet
Phase 2	Mainnet Transition	DAO foundation registration; compliance structure activated
Phase 3	Global Expansion	Partnerships with universities and DAOs in Africa, Europe, and Asia
