Smart Contract & Security Policy.md
CampusNet DAO — Version 1.0 (Devnet Phase)
1. Purpose

This document establishes the governance and technical security standards for all smart contracts deployed under CampusNet DAO (CNET). It defines how contracts are reviewed, audited, deployed, upgraded, and retired to ensure the long-term integrity of the DAO’s infrastructure.

2. Scope

Applies to all on-chain components of CampusNetDAO, including but not limited to:

CNET Token Contracts (mint, distribution, vesting)

Governance Registry Contracts

Treasury Vaults

CampusNetPayHub Integrations

Proposal & Voting Modules

Automation Bots / Off-chain Executors

3. Deployment Policy

Devnet Environment:
All contract testing, iteration, and simulation occurs on Solana Devnet before mainnet deployment.

Mainnet Launch Prerequisites:

Code must pass independent audit by at least one external firm or DAO-accredited security circle.

Contract addresses and verified source code must be published in governance_registry_config.toml and IPFS manifest.

Deployment keys must be multisig-controlled (3-of-5 scheme minimum).

Deployment Roles:

Core DevOps Multisig: executes deployments.

DAO Security Council: verifies signatures and validates audit compliance.

DAO Governance Vote: authorizes new or updated contracts.

4. Audit & Verification Standards

All code commits related to smart contracts must:

Be open-sourced on the DAO’s GitHub under CampusNetDAO/contracts/.

Pass a static analysis using Solana/Anchor linting and security tools.

Have automated unit and integration tests with at least 90% coverage.

Undergo peer review from at least two independent contributors.

Major updates require:

Formal Verification of contract logic.

Publication of Audit Report.md (stored on IPFS).

5. Upgradeability & Version Control

Contracts may only be upgradeable through DAO proposal approval.

Each version must:

Include a new governance hash and recorded in the Governance Hash Registry.

Maintain backward compatibility with DAO state where feasible.

Include migration documentation and testnet validation logs.

Emergency upgrades (critical bug or exploit) require:

Two-thirds (⅔) multisig approval from the Security Council.

Immediate disclosure to the DAO community via governance portal.

6. Treasury & Key Management Security

Treasury wallets are controlled via multisig wallets (3-of-5 minimum).

Signers must represent:

One from Core DevOps,

One from Treasury Committee,

One from Governance Council.

Private keys must:

Be stored on hardware wallets only.

Never shared or transmitted electronically.

Use recovery procedures outlined in Treasury Policy.

7. Bug Bounty & Incident Response

Bounty Program:
White-hat researchers may report vulnerabilities via a signed message to the DAO’s public key.
Severity tiers determine compensation from the security bounty pool.

Incident Protocol:

Isolate affected contract.

Freeze associated vaults if possible.

Convene DAO Security Council.

Publish incident disclosure and mitigation plan.

Audit post-resolution and restore normal operations.

8. Long-Term Governance

Security Council members rotate every 12 months.

Smart contract audits and key integrity checks are performed quarterly.

All governance changes are recorded immutably on IPFS.
