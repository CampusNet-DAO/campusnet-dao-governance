CampusNetDAO — Governance Registry Implementation Specification

Version: v1.0
Document Type: Technical Specification
Status: Draft
Author: CampusNetDAO Core Development Team

1. Overview

This document provides the low-level technical architecture and implementation plan for the CampusNetDAO Governance Registry Contract, responsible for on-chain document verification, version tracking, and governance immutability.

It complements the governance_hash_registry_blueprint.md by defining data models, instruction layouts, and integration logic.

2. Technical Objectives

Immutable Record Keeping — Each governance file (whitepaper, framework, changelog, roadmap) is registered with its IPFS CID + SHA256 hash.

DAO-Driven Authorization — All write operations are gated by governance decisions.

Multi-Signature Verification — Documents must be verified by at least 2 of 3 Council members before being locked.

Upgradeable Contract Architecture — The registry supports versioned logic using Solana’s BPF Loader Upgradeable.

Public Auditability — Anyone can query the registry to confirm authenticity.

4. Data Structures
4.1. DocumentRecord
pub struct DocumentRecord {
    pub doc_id: u64,
    pub ipfs_cid: String,
    pub sha256_hash: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub timestamp: i64,
    pub uploaded_by: Pubkey,
    pub verified_by: Vec<Pubkey>,
    pub proposal_ref: String,
    pub frozen: bool,
}

4.2. RegistryState
pub struct RegistryState {
    pub total_docs: u64,
    pub admin_pubkey: Pubkey,
    pub council_multisig: Vec<Pubkey>,
    pub latest_version_map: HashMap<String, u64>, // e.g. "Whitepaper" => doc_id
}

5. Instructions (Smart Contract Functions)
Function	Description	Access Control
initialize_registry(admin_pubkey, council_multisig)	Deploys and initializes registry state.	DAO Core Team
register_document(ipfs_cid, sha256_hash, version, proposal_ref)	Creates a new document record and emits event.	DAO Vote Execution
verify_document(doc_id, verifier_pubkey)	Adds verifier signature to record.	Governance Council
freeze_document(doc_id)	Locks document from further edits.	DAO Council (≥2 signatures)
update_document(doc_id, new_cid, new_hash, version)	Creates a new version entry.	DAO Governance Vote
get_document(doc_id)	Returns metadata for a record.	Public
get_latest_version(doc_type)	Returns most recent approved document version.	Public
6. On-Chain Events
Event	Description
DocumentRegistered(doc_id, ipfs_cid)	Fired when a new record is added.
DocumentVerified(doc_id, verifier_pubkey)	Fired when a council member verifies.
DocumentFrozen(doc_id)	Fired when record is locked.
VersionUpdated(old_doc_id, new_doc_id)	Fired when a version update occurs.
7. Security Controls

Governance-locked Mutations: All write actions require DAO proposal approval via governance program.

Multi-Sig Enforcement: Minimum of 2 Council signatures required for verification/freeze actions.

Immutable State for Frozen Docs: Once frozen, no updates or deletes permitted.

Cross-verification: SHA256 hash must match IPFS file content before record acceptance.

Upgradeable through Governance: Program upgrade authority lies with DAO-controlled multisig.

8. Integration Interfaces
System	Functionality
CampusNetDAO Portal (Frontend)	UI for document verification, version lookup, and CID history
Realms / Snapshot	Proposal ID linkage for governance traceability
IPFS API / Pinata	File upload + hash generation pipeline
Helius RPC	Transaction monitoring, on-chain event feed
Chainlink Keeper (optional)	Version integrity monitoring automation
9. Workflow Example

Core team uploads document to IPFS.

IPFS returns CID + SHA256 checksum.

Governance proposal created on Realms referencing CID.

Proposal passes → DAO executor triggers register_document() via governance contract.

Council verifies → verify_document() updates the state.

Document is frozen and becomes part of immutable DAO history.

10. Deployment Configuration
Parameter	Value
Cluster	Devnet (for testing), Mainnet (production)
Authority	CampusNetDAO Governance Program
Upgrade Authority	Multisig controlled by DAO (3 of 5 quorum)
RPC Node	https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com or https://rpc.helius.xyz
Storage Provider	IPFS via Pinata or Web3.Storage
Contract Framework	Anchor (Rust)
Version Control	GitHub + IPFS CID mirroring
11. Example Pseudocode (Anchor)
#[program]
pub mod governance_registry {
    use super::*;

    pub fn register_document(ctx: Context<RegisterDocument>, ipfs_cid: String, sha256_hash: String, version: String, proposal_ref: String) -> Result<()> {
        let state = &mut ctx.accounts.state;
        let record = DocumentRecord {
            doc_id: state.total_docs + 1,
            ipfs_cid,
            sha256_hash,
            version,
            timestamp: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
            uploaded_by: *ctx.accounts.signer.key,
            verified_by: vec![],
            proposal_ref,
            frozen: false,
        };
        state.total_docs += 1;
        emit!(DocumentRegistered { doc_id: record.doc_id, ipfs_cid: record.ipfs_cid.clone() });
        Ok(())
    }
}

12. Versioning and Audit Trail
Version	Date	Change Summary
v1.0	Oct 2025	Initial deployment and baseline schema

v1.2 (Future)	Q1 2026	Timestamp oracle integration
v2.0 (Future)	TBD	Cross-chain document verification via Wormhole
13. Development Phases

Phase 1: Contract scaffolding, localnet deployment, schema test.

Phase 2: IPFS + Realms integration, multisig verification logic.

Phase 3: Portal UI with CID query interface.

Phase 4: Security audit & governance upgrade proposal.

Phase 5: Mainnet deployment and IPFS backup anchoring.

14. Endnote

This specification serves as the canonical technical base for the CampusNetDAO governance verification system.
It blends Solana’s high-speed execution layer with IPFS decentralization, ensuring the DAO’s governance history remains transparent, auditable, and incorruptible.
