CampusNetDAO Proposal — CampusDev Funding Program

Version: 1.0
Status: Draft

1. Summary

Launch a structured funding program to support student developers building tools, automations, and community infrastructure for CampusNetDAO.

2. Motivation

The DAO needs a predictable, transparent way to fund student builders. Most students lack the capital or incentive to ship tools that expand CampusNetDAO’s ecosystem. This program closes the gap by aligning incentives and output.

3. Action Plan
Step	Description	Owner	Duration
1	Define bounty categories	Core Contributors	1 week
2	Publish first 10 bounties	Dev Circle	1 week
3	Open application portal	Community Ops	3 days
4	Begin funding cycle	Treasury Circle	Ongoing
4. Budget & Token Allocation
Category	Amount	Notes
Dev Bounties	500,000 CNET	Distributed per task
Reviewer Incentives	50,000 CNET	Performance-based
Ops/Admin	25,000 CNET	Managed by Core Team

Optional SOL pool: 0.5 SOL for critical expenses (off-chain tools, hosting, verification).

5. Expected Outcomes / KPIs

10+ tools shipped in first cycle

30+ student contributors participating

Bounty tracking fully transparent

6. Governance Impact

Reinforces merit-based contribution and aligns incentives across builders, reviewers, and leadership.

7. Voting Parameters
