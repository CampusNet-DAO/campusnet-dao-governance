# Community Lead Onboarding & Incentive Proposal  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** ☐ Draft / ☐ Under Review / ☐ Approved / ☐ Rejected  
**Author:** Governance & Community Circles  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

---

## 1. Proposal Summary  
This proposal seeks to officially onboard **Community Leads** across participating campuses under CampusNetDAO.  
Each lead will coordinate awareness campaigns, manage local DAO chapters, and assist in onboarding new members, ensuring the DAO scales sustainably across institutions.

---

## 2. Motivation  
CampusNetDAO’s growth depends on structured local leadership. Without organized representation on campuses, engagement, adoption, and governance participation remain limited.  
By onboarding dedicated leads, the DAO establishes a decentralized management layer that reflects its community-driven principles.
