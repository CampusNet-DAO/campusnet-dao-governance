CampusNetDAO Membership & Transition Policy

Version: 1.0
Chain: Solana Devnet
Token: CNET
Date: October 2025

1. Purpose

This policy defines the membership structure, entry criteria, and transition process for all participants within CampusNetDAO.
It ensures consistent recognition of contribution, protects governance integrity, and establishes a clear pathway from student participation to long-term ecosystem stewardship.

2. Membership Tiers

CampusNetDAO operates a tiered membership model that reflects commitment, contribution, and governance responsibility.

Tier	Title	Role Description	Governance Rights
Tier 1	Community Member	Any verified participant holding ≥1 CNET token.	Basic voting rights, proposal participation.
Tier 2	Contributor	Active builders, designers, developers, marketers, or coordinators.	Eligible for work-to-earn rewards and internal DAO tasks.
Tier 3	Core Member	Consistent contributors with at least 3 verified projects or DAO votes.	Extended voting rights, proposal co-sponsorship, budget access.
Tier 4	Council Member	Elected governance representatives managing strategic oversight.	Full proposal creation, fund authorization, and constitutional amendment rights.
3. Onboarding Process

All new members must follow a standardized onboarding process to maintain transparency and legitimacy:

Verification – Members authenticate via Discord or wallet signature (Solana wallet).

Registration – A membership form (on the DAO app) records wallet address, role, and university/organization affiliation.

Orientation – Introduction to governance, proposal process, and contribution pathways.

Token Requirement – Members must hold or earn CNET tokens (airdrops, bounties, or rewards).

4. Contributor Activation

To be classified as an active contributor:

Must complete at least one verified task or bounty.

Must maintain consistent participation (minimum one contribution every 60 days).

Contributors inactive beyond 90 days revert to Community Member status.

Rewards are distributed automatically via Work-to-Earn automation linked to bounty tools like Dework or Wonderverse.

5. Council Membership & Transition

Council Members represent the DAO’s leadership tier.

Eligibility Criteria:

Minimum 3 months of verified contribution.

Consistent participation in ≥2 governance votes.

Endorsement by two existing Core or Council Members.

Term & Transition:

Council terms last 6 months.

After term expiration, members must either:

Reapply for re-election, or

Transition to Core Member if inactive.

New council elections are triggered via governance proposals (held quarterly or as required).

Accountability:

Council members failing to participate in two consecutive votes may be subject to automatic downgrade.

6. Transition Policy (Academic Lifecycle Model)

Because CampusNetDAO originates in university ecosystems, member transitions follow the academic lifecycle:

Stage	Member Type	Transition Pathway
Student Member	Undergraduate or graduate currently enrolled.	Eligible for CNET airdrops, DAO training, and contributor onboarding.
Graduating Member	Nearing completion of studies.	Transition to Core Member status via DAO verification (retains governance rights).
Alumni Member	Graduated, not actively contributing.	Retains limited governance privileges; can reapply for active contributor role.
External Partner	Advisors, professionals, or institutional collaborators.	Granted honorary membership with defined voting rights through partnership agreements.
7. Membership Verification and Offboarding

Verification:

Conducted through wallet-based identity (via Collab.Land or Guild.xyz).

Secondary verification includes DAO-admin approval for council or core tiers.

Offboarding:
A member may be deactivated for:

Prolonged inactivity (>120 days).

Policy violation or DAO misconduct.

Voluntary withdrawal from DAO activities.

Offboarded members retain CNET tokens but lose governance privileges until reinstated.

8. Benefits and Privileges
Tier	Benefit Access
Community Members	Access to DAO updates, discussions, and events.
Contributors	Paid work opportunities and performance-based CNET rewards.
Core Members	Access to project budgets, governance co-sponsorship, and leadership tracks.
Council Members	DAO representation authority, decision-making privileges, and treasury co-sign rights.
9. Token-Based Membership Validation

Membership level may also be validated through token staking:

Members may stake CNET to signal commitment and access higher privileges.

Unstaking below minimum threshold automatically reduces role status.

Example thresholds:

Tier	Minimum Stake (CNET)
Community	1
Contributor	100
Core	500
Council	2,000
10. Amendment Policy

Revisions to this Membership & Transition Policy require a Governance Proposal with ≥66% approval and shall be versioned in /changelog/MembershipPolicy.md.

11. Ratification

This Membership & Transition Policy becomes active immediately upon DAO vote approval and replaces any prior membership framework.
