**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Proposal Summary  
This proposal seeks to establish a **strategic partnership** between **CampusNetDAO** and **Web3Edu**, a blockchain education collective.  
The collaboration aims to expand access to verified Web3 learning materials, developer workshops, and student certifications through DAO governance-approved programs.

---

## 2. Motivation  
CampusNetDAO’s mission is to empower students through decentralized education and opportunity.  
Partnering with Web3Edu accelerates that mission by giving students direct access to structured blockchain curricula, developer bootcamps, and certification systems — all without relying on centralized academic gatekeepers.  

This partnership also positions CampusNetDAO as an **academic infrastructure layer for decentralized learning**, increasing legitimacy and visibility across the broader Web3 ecosystem.
