CampusNetDAO Treasury Policy

Version: 1.0
Chain: Solana Devnet
Token: CNET
Date: October 2025

1. Purpose

This policy defines how CampusNetDAO manages, allocates, and safeguards its treasury assets.
The DAO treasury serves as the financial engine powering all initiatives — from contributor compensation and grants to ecosystem growth, infrastructure, and partnerships.

2. Treasury Principles

Transparency: All transactions and allocations must be verifiable on-chain.

Accountability: Fund usage must align with approved governance proposals.

Sustainability: Treasury reserves are managed for long-term viability, not short-term speculation.

Decentralization: No single party has unilateral control over DAO funds.

Security: Multi-signature wallets and verified execution programs are mandatory for fund disbursement.

3. Treasury Composition

The DAO treasury may hold and manage assets in the following forms:

CNET Tokens: Native governance and work-to-earn tokens.

SOL: Used for network fees, payments, and interim contributor rewards.

Stablecoins (USDC/USDT): Used to stabilize the treasury and hedge volatility.

Partner or Grant Tokens: Assets received through collaborations, donations, or accelerator programs.

4. Treasury Structure

Main Treasury:

Managed via a multi-sig wallet controlled by 3–5 elected Council members.

Used for large-scale allocations (bounties, grants, liquidity provisioning, and community campaigns).

Operational Wallets:

Managed by Core Teams (Development, Operations, Marketing) for day-to-day expenses.

Subject to monthly reporting and audit.

Emergency Reserve Wallet:

Holds 10–15% of treasury assets for operational continuity, risk coverage, and technical recovery.

Requires supermajority (≥66%) approval for withdrawal.

5. Allocation and Spending

All treasury expenditures follow the Proposal → Vote → Execution sequence.

Category	Description	Allocation Cap
Contributor Rewards	Compensation for core contributors and working groups	Up to 25% quarterly
Grants & Bounties	Incentives for ecosystem development or education projects	Up to 30% quarterly
Operations & Marketing	Campaigns, events, and collaborations	Up to 20% quarterly
Strategic Partnerships	Funding joint initiatives with educational or blockchain partners	Up to 15% quarterly
Treasury Reserve	Long-term DAO savings, staking, or liquidity	Minimum 10% retained
6. Payment Methods

Primary Payments: In CNET tokens for DAO-based rewards, bounties, or grants.

Secondary Payments: In SOL or USDC when necessary for external payments or stability.

Dual-Asset Compensation: Allowed for hybrid reward systems (e.g., 70% CNET + 30% SOL).

DAO Payroll Automation: Managed via Solana smart contracts or verified payroll services (e.g., Realms or Streamflow).

7. Fund Request Process

Submit a Funding Proposal via the DAO Governance Portal.

Proposal must specify:

Purpose of funds

Amount requested

Wallet address for disbursement

Expected outcomes or milestones

Proposals exceeding 5% of total treasury value require Council review before voting.

Approved proposals are executed programmatically or through multi-sig confirmation.

8. Treasury Reporting

Monthly Reports: All Core Teams must provide a monthly statement of inflows, outflows, and balances.

Quarterly Audits: Conducted by an elected DAO Auditor Group or independent third party.

On-Chain Dashboard: A public treasury dashboard shall be maintained for real-time transparency.

9. Treasury Growth and Investment

Treasury assets may be staked or yield-farmed through DAO-approved protocols for sustainable growth.

Liquidity pools (e.g., CNET/SOL) may be created to support ecosystem expansion.

Any high-risk yield strategies require a supermajority (≥66%) governance approval.

10. Emergency Protocol

If treasury assets are compromised or at risk:

Emergency multi-sig holders may freeze treasury operations temporarily.

A governance proposal for recovery actions must be initiated within 72 hours.

The DAO shall prioritize restoring liquidity and asset protection before resuming normal operations.

11. Policy Amendments

This Treasury Policy can only be amended through DAO governance, requiring:

A supermajority (≥66%) vote,

Updated version numbering,

Public posting of changes in the DAO repository’s /changelog/ directory.

12. Ratification

This Treasury Policy becomes effective immediately upon DAO approval via proposal and remains active until superseded by an updated version.
