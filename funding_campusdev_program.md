# Campus Development Program Funding Proposal  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** ☐ Draft / ☐ Under Review / ☐ Approved / ☐ Rejected  
**Author:** Core Contributor Circle  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

---

## 1. Proposal Summary  
This proposal seeks to fund the **Campus Development Program (CDP)** — an initiative that empowers student developers to design, build, and deploy decentralized tools within the CampusNetDAO ecosystem.  
The goal is to accelerate internal product innovation and onboard technical talent through structured mentorship and tokenized incentives.

---

## 2. Motivation  
The DAO needs sustainable technical growth. Many students possess strong engineering potential but lack guidance, structure, and funding.  
This program bridges that gap — giving contributors a clear framework to learn, build, and earn CNET tokens while expanding the DAO’s codebase and technical reach.
