CampusNetDAO Community Engagement & Rewards Policy

Version: 1.0
Date: October 2025
Token: CNET
Chain: Solana Devnet

1. Purpose

This policy establishes how CampusNetDAO recognizes, incentivizes, and rewards active community participation.
It ensures fair compensation, transparent reward distribution, and sustainable engagement that aligns with DAO goals — empowering students while building a self-sustaining Web3 ecosystem.

2. Guiding Principles

Meritocracy: Rewards are earned through measurable contribution, not position.

Transparency: All reward distributions are public and verifiable on-chain.

Sustainability: Reward models evolve with treasury health and DAO maturity.

Inclusivity: Both students and verified contributors can earn, learn, and grow through participation.

3. Engagement Categories
Category	Description	Reward Type
Governance Participation	Proposal submission, voting, and discussion contributions.	CNET tokens
Technical Contribution	Code commits, bug fixes, system audits, and integrations.	CNET + potential SOL bonus
Creative Contribution	Design, content creation, branding, and campaign execution.	CNET tokens
Community Growth	Hosting meetups, moderating channels, onboarding new members.	CNET tokens + recognition badges
Academic & Research Input	Whitepapers, data analysis, or DAO-related educational projects.	CNET tokens + grant eligibility
4. Work-to-Earn Mechanism

CampusNetDAO operates a Work-to-Earn (W2E) framework integrated with platforms like Dework or Wonderverse, automating contributor tasks and reward issuance.

Workflow

Task Creation: Admins post verified DAO tasks on Dework/Wonderverse.

Application & Approval: Students or contributors claim tasks and await approval.

Completion & Review: Deliverables are submitted and validated by task owners.

Payout: Automated reward disbursement in CNET or SOL (depending on task type).

Recordkeeping: Transaction hashes are stored in /rewards/activity_log/.

5. Reward Distribution Framework
Contributor Type	Reward Source	Frequency	Notes
Core Contributors	Treasury Ops Fund	Biweekly	Long-term consistent contributors
Student Members	Community Fund	Task-based	Earn through verified activities
Council Members	Governance Allocation	Monthly	Rewarded for proposal oversight
External Collaborators	Partnership Pool	Per project	Requires DAO proposal approval
6. Reward Valuation

Reward value fluctuates based on treasury liquidity and token valuation.
Each task or role includes a fixed CNET rate, adjusted quarterly by DAO vote to maintain fairness and economic stability.

Example Rate Table (subject to DAO revision):

Task Type	Base Reward (CNET)
Blog Post / Article	200
Design / UI Work	400
Code Contribution	500–1000
Event Hosting	300
Governance Proposal	250
7. Performance Tiers
Tier	Criteria	Multiplier
Contributor I	< 3 completed tasks	1.0x
Contributor II	3–10 tasks	1.25x
Contributor III	10+ tasks	1.5x
Core Builder	Appointed by DAO vote	2.0x

Tier progression is automatic via reputation tracking smart contracts, ensuring on-chain merit recognition.

8. Reputation and Badges

CampusNetDAO integrates a reputation system (via Guild.xyz or Collab.Land) that:

Verifies wallet-linked activity.

Grants NFT badges for completed milestones (e.g., “Campus Builder,” “DAO Mentor”).

Allows token-gated access to private Discord channels and governance forums.

9. Contributor Grants

Top-tier contributors may apply for Development or Research Grants, funded from the Ecosystem Growth Pool.
Grants are approved through DAO proposals and reviewed quarterly.

Grant size range: 1,000 – 10,000 CNET
All disbursements require post-project reports to ensure accountability.

10. Payment Methods

Primary: CNET tokens

Secondary: SOL (for non-tokenized or external work)

Hybrid compensation permitted for high-value or cross-collaborative tasks.

11. Transparency and Auditing

Reward transactions are published on-chain and mirrored in /logs/rewards/.

Quarterly audit ensures integrity and prevents double-rewarding or abuse.

Violations (spam, duplicate claims, falsified submissions) result in temporary reward suspension or DAO expulsion.

12. Amendment Procedure

Proposed changes to this policy must undergo a DAO proposal and ≥60% majority approval.

Updated versions are tracked via /changelog/CommunityRewards.md and IPFS.
